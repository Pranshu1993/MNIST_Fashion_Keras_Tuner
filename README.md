# MNIST_Fashion_Keras_Tuner

KerasTuner is an easy-to-use, scalable hyperparameter optimization framework that solves the pain points of hyperparameter search. 
Easily configure your search space with a define-by-run syntax, then leverage one of the available search algorithms to find the best hyperparameter values for your models.
KerasTuner comes with Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, and Random Search algorithms built-in, and is also designed to be easy for researchers to extend in order to experiment with new search algorithms.

This implementation shows the Brilliance of Keras-tuner on MNIST Fashion Dataset to increase the validation accuracy to **99%**

Hope you find it interesting!
